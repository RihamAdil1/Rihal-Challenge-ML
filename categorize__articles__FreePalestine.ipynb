But the stories of these friendships, collaborations, alliances, romances or rivalries often are lost in the glow of achievement. In this new feature, we explore a personal connection that made a difference in the lives of two artists. Andre Holland never thought much about writing his own monologues when he attended the Tisch graduate acting program at New York University. But one day, early in his first semester in 2003, he watched another African-American student, Danai Gurira, forgo the usual speeches by white characters and perform her own material instead. Her monologue, about the struggles of black women, had an immediacy and ferocity that led to a bond between them -- as friends, actors and, eventually, writing partners. Ms. Gurira was working on what would become \"In the Continuum,\" the Obie Award-winning play that she co-wrote and starred in Off Broadway. Ms. Gurira would go on to write last year\\'s Tony-nominated play \"Eclipsed\" and act on Broadway and television, where she is best known as Michonne on \"The Walking Dead.\" Mr. Holland is starring in August Wilson\\'s \"Jitney\" on Broadway and as the diner cook Kevin in the film \"Moonlight,\" which is nominated for best picture in this Sunday\\'s Academy Awards.\\n\\nANDRE HOLLAND After seeing that monologue at N.Y.U., I basically followed Danai around for the whole semester. DANAI GURIRA It was very obvious. HOLLAND I was a first-year student. You were a big-deal third-year. GURIRA [laughter] Oh, come on. Most of us were up to our eyeballs in student loans. We were all just trying to get by. HOLLAND All the first-years had to work on the third-years\\' shows. They were doing an August Wilson play, actually -- \"King Hedley II.\" I was working backstage, and I was responsible for firing a backup gun in case the one onstage didn\\'t go off. You fired the gun, right, Danai? HOLLAND One night her gun didn\\'t go off. It took me a second to register what happened. Danai acted it very well.\\n\\nGURIRA It\\'s the climax of the play. I had this split-second where I thought, \"Oh, let me try again.\" And the guy who was supposed to be shot -- his face was like: \"Was I shot? Was I not shot?\" Then Dre fired the backup and saved us. GURIRA We were all very keen to see Dre get a show where he was the clear lead. But it takes awhile. HOLLAND In my third year I got Tartuffe. GURIRA The character is a scoundrel, and we all looked at Andre as this sweet, kind guy. I found myself kind of rooting for Tartuffe because Andre is so likable.\\n\\nHOLLAND N.Y.U. was a magical place for me. I was living out in West New York, N.J., in a $500-a-month bedroom and taking the bus in at 6:30 a.m. But then you get to the classroom and it was just constant creativity, working from 9 a.m. to midnight. GURIRA I still go to Tisch to block out a room when I need to work something out quickly. I did that with all my plays. It\\'s about being back in those very humble classrooms. The place kept Dre and I humble. HOLLAND A few years after, we ended up making our Broadway debuts together, in another August Wilson play, \"Joe Turner\\'s Come and Gone.\"\\n\\nGURIRA Our characters never met onstage. But that\\'s when we became good, good friends offstage. HOLLAND It was a highly pressurized situation. Bart Sher was directing. There were a lot of feelings about us having a white director on a Wilson classic like \"Joe Turner.\" And the ending of the play -- well, we as a cast were struggling to find the right ending. Danai and I talked about it a lot outside of rehearsals. \"What are we doing? How do we figure this out?\" I was struggling with my character, Jeremy -- there were things that the play was asking me to do, and other things that the director was asking me to do, and those two things don\\'t always line up. I trusted her implicitly. \"Does this make sense?\" I\\'d ask her. \"Is this clear?\"\\n\\nGURIRA My character, Martha Pentecost, came onstage at the very end of the play. She is facing the husband she left years earlier back in the South. It was tough to figure out how to play the ending. We were taught in our N.Y.U. training that collaboration is not cooperation. You need to leave your ego outside; it\\'s about finding the best work. That was a place that both Andre and I came from. August Wilson is such a deep, spiritual writer. You just can\\'t come at it intellectually; you had to come at it deep. I leaned a lot on Dre. I got to know the poeticness of Dre\\'s Southern background. I needed that for Martha. HOLLAND Mostly, I just sat there listening. Danai had most of the answers about what she needed to do with the character. GURIRA It wasn\\'t that Bart wanted one thing and I wanted another. A lot of it was time pressure -- it was a three-hour play and a huge amount to rehearse. HOLLAND A lot of the time it was just giving each other space to express things that you can\\'t express easily in front of the director and the rehearsal room. We talked about the church a lot, religion a lot. GURIRA Two years later we did \"Measure for Measure\" in Central Park. We didn\\'t know each other was auditioning. No idea.\\n\\nGURIRA Ridiculous! I literally had no idea you had been cast when I came in. But what was great was that you made it easier for me to find that thing that my character needed. My goal for my character, Isabella, was that she wasn\\'t going to be someone that the audience could judge easily. Isabella has to decide whether to save her brother, who is in prison. She doesn\\'t agree with things he has done, but Dre, as Claudio, made me want to save him. HOLLAND I talk to Danai more than anyone in terms of work. All these plays I\\'ve done -- Danai came to see \"Jitney\" recently, and she is the only person I talk to about the work. She had a couple good ideas. I\\'m working hard to put them in. I\\'ll keep the specifics to myself. [laughter] GURIRA A lot of it is about decision-making in our careers. We remind each other of who we are, what we want, where we want to go. We can get caught up in the moment of the thing you are working on. We remind each other of what we said last year, or five years ago, about what we wanted in life. HOLLAND We\\'re working on a screenplay now together. It\\'s based on the book \"A Native of Nowhere,\" and it\\'s a fascinating story about one man\\'s life. It\\'s early going, but I\\'ve always been interested in writing. I have stacks of notebooks that I\\'ve filled with stories.', 'abstract': 'André Holland first saw Danai Gurira at New York University, performing a monologue she wrote.

This documentary, the latest offering from Barack Obama and Michelle Obama\\'s production company, draws a direct line between a Catskills summer camp and the American disability rights movement of the 1970s. Directed by Jim LeBrecht and Nicole Newnham, the film begins by focusing on Camp Jened, which was founded in the early 1950s and served as a community for campers with disabilities. But it eventually shifts focus to look at the adult lives of some of the camp\\'s alumni, several of whom became prominent activists. In his review for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that the film \"unfolds from a perspective of lived experience.\" Newnham and LeBrecht, he added, \"deftly juggle a large cast of characters past and present, accomplishing the not-so-easy task of making all the personalities distinct.\"\\n\\nDARK PHOENIX (2019) 9 p.m. on HBO. In an interview with The Times last year, the actress Sophie Turner discussed the moment when Simon Kinberg, the writer and director of \"Dark Phoenix,\" made clear how much the movie would rely on Turner\\'s performance. \"I just [expletive] my pants right there and then,\" Turner said. But she made it through. This most recent \"X-Men\" movie casts Turner, a star best known for \"Game of Thrones,\" as Jean Grey, a young mutant whose abnormally potent powers threaten to get the better of her. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy reprise their roles as Magneto and Professor X, alongside Jessica Chastain as an alien modeled partly on Tilda Swinton. For the most part, Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times, Kinberg \"just moves characters from point A to B, pausing for face-to-face heart to hearts before the next blowout.\" But, she added, \"the mayhem is generally coherent and executed with clean, crisp special effects, even if Kinberg settles for slo-mo cliches.\"\\n\\nBLACKHAT (2015) 5:20 p.m. on FXM. Cybercrime has incendiary results in \"Blackhat,\" a thriller directed by Michael Mann. The story begins with an explosion at a Hong Kong nuclear facility. Enter Chris Hemsworth and Tang Wei, who play unlikely heroes tasked with tracking down the mysterious hacker responsible for the attack. The result is \"by turns brutal and sentimental, lovely and lurid, as serious as the grave and blissfully preposterous,\" Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times.

            "Article 3: {'section': 'Sports', 'headline': 'Rays Stick to Their Plan and Reach a 2nd World Series', 'article_url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/17/sports/baseball/rays-beat-astros-game-7.html', 'article': 'The Tampa Bay Rays told Charlie Morton it would happen. When they chased him as a free agent before last season, their front office did not present to him this precise scenario -- an unprecedented path to the World Series, with him leading the way -- but they shared their methodology. Part of Morton recoiled at the message. \"\\'Hey, we don\\'t need you to go seven, eight innings -- we\\'re built so that you give us five or six good ones and we\\'ll take care of the rest,\\'\" Morton, 36, said earlier this month, recalling the Rays\\' pitch to him. \"I don\\'t know how I feel about that; coming up, you want to go seven, eight. You want that complete game.\" Morton\\'s role models as a young major leaguer were other tall right-handers who craved big moments and burned to work deep into games: Roy Halladay, Chris Carpenter, Adam Wainwright and A.J. Burnett. His generation of pitchers, Morton said, is probably the last to be raised with that mentality. \"And you just see this evolution in the game -- teams would rather have you go out and strike a bunch of guys out over five or six innings,\" he added. \"I don\\'t know, it\\'s kind of sad to see -- but the guys that can consistently go out and give you six, seven, eight innings, two to four runs, and throw 200 innings a year, I think that\\'s gone the way of the dodo bird.\"\\n\\nNowhere was the evolution of the baseball kingdom more obvious than in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series on Saturday night in San Diego. The Rays stuck to their principles at the pivotal moment, and the reward was a 4-2 victory over the Houston Astros that sent them to their second World Series. In their first, in 2008, they lost to the Philadelphia Phillies. The Rays won the first three games of this A.L.C.S., then lost three in a row. Only once before had a team done that in a best-of-seven series, and that team -- the 2004 Yankees -- was beaten soundly in Game 7 by the Boston Red Sox. The Rays, then, had no precedent for recovering from such a tumble. \"I don\\'t know if I went to bed,\" Manager Kevin Cash said when asked about his torment after losing Game 6 on Friday. \"It was tough, there\\'s no doubt. A lot of anxiety. Believe me, we\\'ve all watched \\'Four Days in October.\\' I didn\\'t want to see it again.\"\\n* None\\n* Everyone Loves Ohtani: The Angels\\' two-way star was a unanimous pick for A.L. M.V.P. and his superfans redefine devotion.\\n* Phillie Phavorite: Bryce Harper truly committed to Philadelphia and now he\\'s back on top of baseball, winning the N.L. M.V.P.\\n* Cy Young Winners: Milwaukee\\'s Corbin Burnes and Toronto\\'s Robbie Ray had hit rock bottom before they worked their way up to stardom.\\n* Baseball Is Stuck in Neutral: The potential of a lockout has a star-studded group of free agents waiting for the dust to settle.\\n* Free-Agency Tracker: Get the latest updates on signings, contract extensions and trades. Cash was referring to a documentary about Boston\\'s famous comeback; several Astros said they had watched it for inspiration as they attempted to match the feat. But Houston fell one win short, and Cash\\'s discipline with Morton was a big reason. Morton, who won Game 7s in the A.L.C.S. and the World Series for Houston in 2017, retired 16 of his first 17 hitters on Saturday and took a 3-0 lead into the sixth inning behind homers by Randy Arozarena and Mike Zunino. Morton was extremely efficient; after a walk and a two-out infield single in the sixth, he had thrown just 66 pitches, about two-thirds of a traditional starter\\'s workload.\\n\\n\"It was pretty simple: third time through, we value that, we value our process,\" Cash said. \"Michael Brantley\\'s as talented a hitter as anybody in baseball, and if you give him too many looks, he\\'s going to get you. The leverage at that point might not have been any higher in the game.\" Anderson gave him a better matchup, Cash insisted, and the crux of the Rays\\' approach is to tilt as many matchups as possible in their favor. The Rays try to limit the number of times opposing hitters face their pitchers, and batters hit .381 this season when facing Morton for the third time in a game. At that moment, Cash said, he could not abandon the script -- even if the instinct of most viewers, including the one with the best angle of all, screamed otherwise. \"I want to say yes,\" said Zunino, the catcher, when asked if he was surprised to see Morton leave. \"But Cash pulls all the right moves. This was the best I\\'ve seen Charlie in the time I\\'ve been able to catch him in the past two years. He had everything working.\" On the TBS broadcast, the play-by-play announcer Brian Anderson said that \"all of Twitter is ablaze\" as the screen showed a tweet from the Phillies\\' Andrew McCutchen, a former teammate of Morton\\'s with Pittsburgh. McCutchen wrote he would have left Morton in, and the analyst Jeff Francoeur said he agreed.\\n\\nVindication came quickly for Cash when Brantley rolled the second pitch, a 97 mile-an-hour fastball, to second base for a groundout, keeping the shutout intact. When Brantley came up again in the eighth, Cash dutifully summoned a new pitcher, Pete Fairbanks, a hulking young right-hander who throws even harder than Anderson. Fairbanks allowed two runs when Correa grounded a single to right against an overshifted infield. But he locked down the pennant in the ninth when Aledmys Diaz, the potential tying run, flied out to Manuel Margot in right. It was Morton\\'s second victory of the A.L.C.S., and while he fired 10 2/3  shutout innings in the series, the Most Valuable Player Award went to Arozarena, a breakout October star. Arozarena hit .321 in the A.L.C.S. -- the rest of the Rays batted .183 -- and smashed four home runs. He now has seven this postseason, a rookie record. \"We\\'ve been facing some great pitchers and some great teams,\" Arozarena said through an interpreter. \"But the ball\\'s looking good. The ball\\'s looking real nice to me.\" His two-run homer in the first inning, off Lance McCullers Jr., erased any momentum the Astros had earned with their three wins while facing elimination. But Morton had a sense his team would be fine. \"After last night, it\\'s like -- you give away a 3-0 lead, and I came to the park today and everybody\\'s just good to go, squared away, high energy in the first inning,\" he said. \"They\\'re out there just hungry for the win.\" It took longer than they had hoped, but the Rays got that win on Saturday, and they did it their way.', 'abstract': \"Guided by the club's strict principles, Manager Kevin Cash pulled his pitcher at a crucial point in Game 7 and was rewarded with a victory over the Houston Astros.\", 'article_id': '3da821ea-b93b-5a09-99d7-45e1711b73f0', 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/19/sports/17kepner-alcs-print/17kepner-alcs-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=bc949a95413e755caaf5b16631534bd4dfb7d275a1eb2241e69799501299c4ec&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN', 'caption': 'The Rays celebrated after the final out of their Game 7 win.', 'image_id': '3da821ea-b93b-5a09-99d7-45e1711b73f0'}\n",
            "Article 4: {'section': 'Art & Design', 'headline': 'For Robert Rauschenberg, No Artist Is an Island', 'article_url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/arts/design/for-robert-rauschenberg-no-artist-is-an-island.html', 'article': 'We tend to think of artists as natural loners, off in their studios, wrestling with their inner selves. But \"Robert Rauschenberg: Among Friends,\" which opens at the Museum of Modern Art on May 21, points us in a different direction. It situates Rauschenberg\\'s work amid that of two dozen fellow artists who provided an audience for one another in New York City in the \\'50s and \\'60s, the years of bohemia\\'s final flourish. Not that exchanges between artists are ever simple. Rauschenberg\\'s \"Bed,\" for instance, is a landmark painting from 1955 that stands about six feet tall, with a stapled-on pillow, a cotton sheet splotched with red and yellow, and rivulets of white pigment dripping onto a patchwork quilt. Like any true masterpiece, \"Bed\" can support multiple readings. You can see it, for starters, as a brilliant sendup of the overt emotionalism of Abstract Expressionism and say that it puts \\'50s-style paint-slinging to bed.\\n\\nIn his defense, Rauschenberg, who died in 2008, at 82, could have cited Picasso\\'s oft-quoted remark about how \"good artists copy, great artists steal.\" Granted, Picasso was referring to the theft of ideas, as opposed to actual objects. But for Rauschenberg, objects were the idea. It was a wholly optimistic belief. He delighted in the scruffy plenitude of the world, and he wanted to stretch the boundaries of painting to make room for things besides canvas and oil paint. His combines, as he called them, came to include crumpled newspapers and neckties and even a taxidermied goat. He did not invent assemblage, but he endowed it with scale, supersized it. Rauschenberg was charismatic and engaging. He saw himself as a work in progress (self-assembly required), and even his name was subject to revision. His parents named him Milton Ernest Rauschenberg. When he declared himself an artist, he changed his name to Bob. After people assumed, reasonably, that his name was actually Robert, he changed it to that.\\n\\nThe MoMA exhibition, \"Among Friends,\" has been conceived by the curator Leah Dickerman as an \"open monograph,\" to borrow her revelatory phrase. It presents Rauschenberg as an essential connector not only among artists but also between the art world as a whole and the neighboring worlds of avant-garde dance and performance. His collaborations were frequent. They ranged from one-time improvisations -- such as his black-streaked \"Automobile Tire Print,\" which he made by having the musician John Cage drive his car over 20 sheets of paper in the street -- to a decade of sustained creativity as the resident designer of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. In art-history textbooks, Rauschenberg is invariably paired with Jasper Johns as a historic figure who \"ushered in the Pop art era.\" But today that description seems dated and inadequate. Their work has none of Pop\\'s screaming irony, none of its poster-like graphic speed. Johns, who turns 87 this month, forever changed the way we think about process, building up the surfaces of his paintings with slow, sensuous, wax-laden marks that seem to fold the flow of his time into his imagery. His achievement was to imbue American art with a seriousness, a philosophical largeness, that had previously belonged to European culture. Rauschenberg, by contrast, was interested in flouting rules and establishing freedoms, in making the art world a more open place.\\n\\nRauschenberg\\'s ethos of inclusiveness was probably rooted as much in his belief in social equality as in the hardships of his childhood. Born in 1925, he grew up during the Depression years in Port Arthur, Tex., an oil-refining town in the swampy southeastern part of the state. Not enough has been said about his dyslexia, which remained undiagnosed in his childhood. He later recalled that he harbored deep shame over his inability to keep up at school. He couldn\\'t read, he said, because the letter \"r\" kept jumping off the page. He generally printed in capital letters, and his spelling was inventive. In a 1954 costume drawing for the Cunningham dance \"Minutiae,\" Rauschenberg refers to \"tourqoise\" and \"torqoise,\" to \"fushia\" and \"fuchsia.\" \"He told me so many times that he thought he was dumb when he was young,\" recalled his sister, Janet Begneaud, when we met in March in Lafayette, La., where the family eventually settled. Instead of poring over books, Rauschenberg had his own style of learning. He could imagine a sentence as a series of pictures, and cutout photographs from magazines proliferated on the walls of his boyhood bedroom. He became an attentive listener who picked up information from everyone he met. During World War II, he served in the Navy as a psychiatric nurse.\\n\\nEven so, having grown up amid the intolerance of the South, he learned to avoid certain topics at home. One of them was his homosexuality. \"I doubt Mother knew that it existed in the world,\" Ms. Begneaud said. \"I guarantee she had no idea.\" His parents were Christian fundamentalists who went to church two times every Sunday. Rauschenberg had ample opportunity to hear about the torments of hell, which piqued his imagination. In 1958, in an application for a Guggenheim grant, he proposed that he illustrate Dante\\'s \"Inferno\" in 34 drawings, one for each canto. He was passed over for the grant, but he did complete the series of drawings, as the MoMA show will attest. They\\'re among his best works, combining freely sketched passages with images from newspapers and magazines; they translate a 14th-century epic into a language of his own devising. The \"Inferno\" drawings represent, among other things, a triumph over Rauschenberg\\'s dyslexia, signaling his love of literature. \"I had a book of Botticelli\\'s wonderful illustrations of the \\'Inferno,\\'\" Mr. Johns noted recently, referring to the years when he lived a flight below Rauschenberg in a loft building on Front Street. \"I believe that Bob\\'s looking at that triggered his own.\" Does Dante count as one of Rauschenberg\\'s collaborators? Probably more than Charles Atlas, a video artist prized for his work with choreographers. Now 68, Mr. Atlas is still lanky and boyish, with sideburns that are dyed psychedelic orange. \"Someone had the good idea to hire me,\" he said with a chuckle when we met recently at MoMA. \"It\\'s the first time they have hired an artist to do anything like this.\" Mr. Atlas is designing the video portion of the show, including a nine-channel installation to commemorate \"9 Evenings,\" a series of quixotic performances that Rauschenberg spearheaded in 1966 with his engineer-friend Billy Kluver, in the hope of forming a brave new alliance between art and technology. \"Bob was so out there,\" recalled Susan Weil, a native Manhattanite who met him in Paris as an art student at the Academie Julian in the summer after she finished high school. He was 22 and studying on the G.I. Bill. In the fall, he followed her to Black Mountain College. They married in 1950 and moved to West 95th Street, into a cramped studio apartment. The MoMA show will open with their collaborations -- namely, the so-called \"blueprints,\" life-size photograms in which their bodies appear as white silhouettes bathed against a Prussian blue background.', 'abstract': \"A writer travels from Brooklyn to Lafayette, La., in search of an artist's roots, upon the opening of an exhibition of at the Museum of Modern Art.\", 'article_id': 'becf4474-d1fa-5722-b829-251530aa942b', 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/14/arts/14RAUSCHENBERG1/14RAUSCHENBERG1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=3c0778eeda10612985706d457b37c2fb084dde7d4ef6dc46e43c2eeaeeccdae8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN', 'caption': 'Robert Rauschenberg performing in \"Pelican\" in 1965.', 'image_id': 'becf4474-d1fa-5722-b829-251530aa942b'}\n",

A pragmatic man, he couldn\\'t help teaching me when to hedge my bets, especially when it came to playing Uno. Unfortunately, he never could have prepared me for the odds I would face in the years to come. Shortly after celebrating my 25th birthday, I was given a diagnosis of Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma. After some research and a healthy dose of naivete, I felt I could kick it pretty swiftly. After all, everyone reassured me that I had the \"good kind\" of cancer, with an over 90 percent survival rate. Those were odds my grandfather taught me I could get behind. But two months into treatment, the odds changed; my cancer didn\\'t respond to standard chemotherapy and had begun growing out of control. I now truly feared my own mortality. But most of all, I feared the excoriating pain and emptiness my family would feel if I weren\\'t to survive. What would my mom do each year on my birthday? How would my brother and sister feel knowing I would never meet my unborn nieces and nephews? Who would take my place on my best friend\\'s speed dial? Those fears motivated me to fight. My job now was to simply stay alive. I headed south from New York City for Houston to undergo salvage chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant.\\n\\nMy life turned upside down, and before I knew it, I no longer recognized myself in the mirror. My hair, including eyebrows and eyelashes, fell out. My face became swollen from steroids while my body grew thin. Purple marks decorated my joints and eye sockets. As my chemo cocktails became stronger, I became weaker. I endured five months of chemotherapy just to prepare me for an autologous stem cell transplant, which marshals my own stem cells. But the transplant left my immune system compromised, forcing me into isolation for over a month. My jail cell was a 10-by-10-foot hospital room, and my restraints were IV poles carrying dozens of drugs. My fevers spiked above 104, sores lined my throat leaving me unable to swallow. I had to get my nutrition through the IV. This was the closest I had ever felt to death, but I was too sick and too weak to be scared. After 10 months, I returned to my old life in New York, but I had left as one person and came back as another. I was surrounded by friends, and a boyfriend who tried to be supportive. But how could they understand the crippling fears of dying I faced almost every waking minute? I was now given a 75 percent chance of survival but never felt as if cancer was done with me. I spent hundreds of hours, and thousands of dollars, on psychotherapy, trying to figure out if my fears were justified. A year later, it turned out they were. I relapsed. No one could tell me my odds of survival now, but I didn\\'t need my grandfather\\'s Ph.D. in statistics to know they were not good. I went back to Texas, where the doctors wanted me to undergo a second stem cell transplant, this time from a donor. There are over 14 million people on the stem cell/bone marrow registry worldwide, but not one was a perfect match for me. Now, I needed to find a way to buy myself a few years, in hopes that the next miracle drug was around the corner.\\n\\nWith no traditional options left, I enrolled in a clinical trial. At best only a few hundred people around the world had taken the drug being tested, and no one really knew what it did to you. It made me as sick as traditional chemotherapy, required full body scans every three to six weeks (that\\'s a lot of radiation) and lots of platelet transfusions. But miraculously, it put me into complete remission. They told me I was only one of two people known to achieve this. Doctors didn\\'t know if the drug would keep me in remission, or whether I should stay on it or not. We took a gamble. I went off it and began proton therapy, a new approach to radiation at the time. It was more targeted, with less damage to healthy tissue, but there was little data on its use for lymphomas. I finished 35 rounds of radiation and was still in complete remission. After seven months I was finished with treatment, but now came the hard part: once again living my life scan-to-scan and playing the cruel mental game of wondering what the chances were that my cancer would return. It\\'s been seven years and I\\'m still waiting. My doctor and I will never use the word \"cure\" and while I\\'m unsure I\\'ll ever fully \"move on,\" I\\'ve been living life to the fullest. I moved to Chicago to be closer to family, and there met my husband. My doctors had told me the transplant would leave me infertile, unable to ever conceive, but together we somehow produced the most amazing daughter. We say she was destined to be here, and she is. Like many new mothers, I had postpartum anxiety, anxiety that was amplified by my complex medical history and the unanswered questions that overwhelmed me. How much time do I have before my cancer returns again? What are the odds that I will see my daughter grow up, that I will take her to her first day of school, see her off to college or walk her down the aisle on her wedding day? When my daughter was 8 months old, I ended up in the emergency room the day after Thanksgiving after a terrible headache that had lasted for three days. An hour after I had a CT scan, a young doctor came in and told me I had a large mass on the right side of my brain. She suggested there was a good chance my lymphoma was back and had spread to my brain, telling me this almost with a sense of pride, as if she had solved a great mystery. I was paralyzed by the news and wanted to rip the IV out of my arm and run home to my daughter, but I couldn\\'t move. I felt an arm come around me and looked up to see my husband crying, the only time I\\'ve ever seen him shed tears. After several weeks of doctors\\' appointments and many scans and medical tests later, the doctors concluded there was nothing malignant lurking in my brain. I had suffered a stroke and am now epileptic and often have severe headaches because of it, but I did not have cancer.\\n\\nDuring this tumultuous time, I had an epiphany that maybe cancer wouldn\\'t be my undoing. I\\'m still not sure if this is a good thing or not. But what I do know is that bad things can come out of nowhere and at any time. And against all odds, I am still here. So nearly a decade after I was first given a cancer diagnosis, this is my declaration: I\\'m done with the statistics. I could continue to obsess over cold and unforgiving facts, or I could choose to be present and enjoy all the beautiful moments that make life worth living, from seeing my daughter\\'s face light up every time she hears a song from \"Mamma Mia!\" to watching how my husband carefully takes her hand to help her walk down the aisles at the grocery store. These are the moments I will fully absorb and be grateful for, rather than counting down how many of them I may have left. If my grandfather were still alive, I\\'m sure he\\'d agree.', 'abstract': 'I could continue to obsess over cold facts, or I could choose to be present and enjoy all the beautiful moments that make life worth living.', 'article_id': 'ea5d9278-91a4-513c-8497-56f5654ee2dd', 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/22/well/voices-odds/voices-odds-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=540cea8043ae08bef25198eac508c7e49943858d8501fc7419bd65d6e186b904&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN', 'caption': 'The author, Katie Palay, with her husband and child.', 'image_id': 'ea5d9278-91a4-513c-8497-56f5654ee2dd'}\n",

It is separate from the newsroom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot still missing from the reports that Russia paid for attacks on American and other coalition forces in Afghanistan. That\\'s why it\\'s critical that emotions and politics be kept at bay until the facts are in. Some important context might come from a hearing on the matter by the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday, even though Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, has declined to attend. The charges are explosive, and the public -- especially the families of fallen soldiers -- deserves some honest answers. The reports in The Times and other news media cite intelligence findings that a Russian military intelligence unit rewarded fighters linked to the Taliban for targeting American troops, possibly disbursing money through a shadowy Afghan middleman named Rahmatullah Azizi. The findings are said to have been relayed to the White House in a regular intelligence briefing that President Trump says he never saw. The logical next step for the president should have been to acknowledge the gravity of the allegations and demand a full report. Instead, Mr. Trump dismissed the story in a tweet as \"just another made up by Fake News tale that is told only to damage me and the Republican Party,\" even as he acknowledged that the information was contained in intelligence reports. Inevitably, the response resurrected speculation about Mr. Trump\\'s unexplained affinity for Vladimir Putin, most recently displayed in attempts to include the Russian leader in a meeting of the Group of 7. Robert O\\'Brien, the national security adviser, said this month that the Justice Department was considering an investigation into whomever may have leaked the information.\\n\\nThe Trump administration\\'s response to this story raises critical questions about whether it is focusing sufficient attention on the plight of American soldiers deployed far from their homeland and on dangerous ground. John Bolton\\'s new book about his time as Mr. Trump\\'s national security adviser is only the latest depiction of a president incapable of absorbing policy briefings. But this issue is not solely a question of Mr. Trump\\'s competence. From the various news accounts, others in the White House and Congress were also apparently advised of the claims, yet no one reacted until the allegations were made public in The Times. Then there\\'s the question of the motives behind the leaks and the solidity of the information. The Wall Street Journal, for one, reported that the National Security Agency -- which specializes in electronic espionage -- strongly dissented from other intelligence agencies over the strength of the intelligence. For agencies to differ in their assessments of intelligence is not unusual in the business of espionage, which by its nature often deals in circumstantial evidence. What the differences were in this case is not known, but they probably account for Mr. Trump\\'s claim that the intelligence did not reach him because it \"didn\\'t rise to that level.\" Other questions abound: When did the reported payments begin? Were they payback for American support of Afghan militants against Soviet troops there in the 1980s, or something else? Were the payments a factor in the deaths of any American or other coalition troops? Was the intelligence tweaked by people seeking to hinder efforts to withdraw American troops? Coalition forces suffered a spate of casualties in Afghanistan last summer and early fall, but there have been only a few deaths since. Four Americans were killed by hostile fire incidents early this year, but the Taliban has not attacked American positions since it signed an agreement with the United States in late February. (Five other Americans died this year in nonhostile accidents or crashes.) A spokesman for the Taliban said the reports of any deal with Russian intelligence agencies were \"baseless.\" Russian officials have said they\\'ll respond if and when they hear concrete accusations.\\n\\nMr. Pompeo has declined to comment on the specifics of the intelligence reports of bounties, but he noted in a recent interview that Russia\\'s involvement in Afghanistan was nothing new and was regularly raised with Russian officials. \"There are many folks using the Taliban or who have used the Taliban over years and years and years as proxy forces,\" he said, noting that Iran and Pakistan have also provided aid to the Taliban over the years. Afghanistan is a forbidding country that has repeatedly confounded invaders. There is no question that the war there has been rife with atrocities, shifting alliances and dubious sources of funds and arms. Mr. Trump is right to try to pull Americans out after more than two decades of inconclusive fighting. Yet the public anger aroused by the bounties story will not go away by claiming \"hoax,\" or dismissing the payments as collateral damage of a dirty war. Legislators from both parties are already demanding explanations, and the House Armed Services Committee voted by a large bipartisan majority for an amendment to the defense bill to make any further withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan contingent on an assessment of whether any country has offered incentives for the Taliban to attack American and other coalition troops. It is unfortunate to connect the issue of possible Russian payoffs with the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The administration ought to provide more information to lawmakers, which is why it was a missed opportunity for Mr. Pompeo to decline to attend the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. But whatever those investigations reveal, the war in Afghanistan needs to be brought to an end. Mr. Putin\\'s intelligence services shouldn\\'t get a say in what is in the best interests of the United States. The threat to Mr. Trump\\'s withdrawal deal alone should encourage the president to get to the bottom of the issue, and if necessary to confront Russia with the numerous tools of statecraft at his disposal.', 'abstract': 'Allegations of bounties paid for the deaths of U.S. soldiers are serious.

Some have hopped off, moving shows not relevant to the issues of racism and police brutality away from June 19. Many have hopped on, adding hastily assembled commemorations or other shows with African-American themes or casts, largely reruns and back-catalog documentaries.\\n\\nThe sister cable networks AMC and IFC, however, were already set. They announced in mid-May that the winsomely titled one-hour special \"Sherman\\'s Showcase \\'Black History Month Spectacular\\'\" would be \"premiering Juneteenth\" -- four months away from Black History Month, but on a particularly appropriate date that virtually no one else was talking about at the time.\\n\\nPoints for awareness, then.

            "Article 5: {'section': 'Global Business', 'headline': 'Cigarette Giants in Global Fight on Tighter Rules', 'article_url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/business/global/14smoke.html', 'article': 'As sales to developing nations become ever more important to giant tobacco companies, they are stepping up efforts around the world to fight tough restrictions on the marketing of cigarettes. Companies like Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco are contesting limits on ads in Britain, bigger health warnings in South America and higher cigarette taxes in the Philippines and Mexico. They are also spending billions on lobbying and marketing campaigns in Africa and Asia, and in one case provided undisclosed financing for TV commercials in Australia. The industry has ramped up its efforts in advance of a gathering in Uruguay this week of public health officials from 171 nations, who plan to shape guidelines to enforce a global anti-smoking treaty. This year, Philip Morris International sued the government of Uruguay, saying its tobacco regulations were excessive. World Health Organization officials say the suit represents an effort by the industry to intimidate the country, as well as other nations attending the conference, that are considering strict marketing requirements for tobacco.\\n\\nUruguay\\'s groundbreaking law mandates that health warnings cover 80 percent of cigarette packages. It also limits each brand, like Marlboro, to one package design, so that alternate designs don\\'t mislead smokers into believing the products inside are less harmful. The lawsuit against Uruguay, filed at a World Bank affiliate in Washington, seeks unspecified damages for lost profits. \"They\\'re using litigation to threaten low- and middle-income countries,\" says Dr. Douglas Bettcher, head of the W.H.O.\\'s Tobacco Free Initiative. Uruguay\\'s gross domestic product is half the size of the company\\'s $66 billion in annual sales. Peter Nixon, a vice president and spokesman for Philip Morris International, said the company was complying with every nation\\'s marketing laws while selling a lawful product for adult consumers. He said the company\\'s lawsuits were intended to combat what it felt were \"excessive\" regulations, and to protect its trademark and commercial property rights.\\n\\nCigarette companies are aggressively recruiting new customers in developing nations, Dr. Bettcher said, to replace those who are quitting or dying in the United States and Europe, where smoking rates have fallen precipitously. Worldwide cigarette sales are rising 2 percent a year. But the number of countries adopting tougher rules, as well as the global treaty, underscore the breadth of the battleground between tobacco and public health interests in legal and political arenas from Latin America to Africa to Asia. The cigarette companies work together to fight some strict policies and go their separate ways on others. For instance, Philip Morris USA, a division of Altria Group, helped negotiate and supported the anti-smoking legislation passed by Congress last year and did not join a lawsuit filed by R. J. Reynolds, Lorillard and other tobacco companies against the Food and Drug Administration. So far, it is not protesting the agency\\'s new rules, proposed last week, requiring graphic images with health warnings on cigarette packs. But Philip Morris International, the separate company spun out of Altria in 2008 to expand the company\\'s presence in foreign markets, has been especially aggressive in fighting new restrictions overseas. It has not only sued Uruguay, but also Brazil, arguing that images the government wants to put on cigarette packages do not accurately depict the health effects of smoking and \"vilify\" tobacco companies. The pictures depict more grotesque health effects than the smaller labels recommended in the United States, including one showing a fetus with the warning that smoking can cause spontaneous abortion. In Ireland and Norway, Philip Morris subsidiaries are suing over prohibitions on store displays. In Australia, where the government announced a plan that would require cigarettes to be in plain brown or white packaging to make them less attractive to buyers, a Philip Morris official directed an opposition media campaign during the federal elections last summer, according to documents obtained by an Australian television program, and later obtained by The New York Times.\\n\\nMr. Nixon, the spokesman, said Philip Morris made no secret of its financing of that effort. \"We have helped them, not controlled them,\" he said. Mr. Nixon said Philip Morris agreed that smoking was harmful and supported \"reasonable\" regulations where none exist. \"The packages definitely need health warnings, but they\\'ve got to be a reasonable size,\" he said. \"We thought 50 percent was reasonable. Once you take it up to 80 percent, there\\'s no space for trademarks to be shown. We thought that was going too far.\" These days in courts around the world, the tobacco giants find themselves on the defensive far more than playing offense. The W.H.O. and its treaty encourage governments and individuals to take legal action against cigarette corporations, which have encountered growing numbers of lawsuits from smokers and health care systems in Brazil, Canada, Israel, Italy, Nigeria, Poland and Turkey. But in other parts of the world, notably Indonesia, the fifth-largest cigarette market, which has little regulation, tobacco companies market their products in ways that are prohibited elsewhere. In Indonesia, cigarette ads run on TV and before movies; billboards dot the highways; companies appeal to children through concerts and sports events; cartoon characters adorn packages; and stores sell to children. Officials in Indonesia say they depend on tobacco jobs, as well as revenue from excise taxes on cigarettes. Indonesia gets some $2.5 billion a year from Philip Morris International alone.\\n\\nThe International Tobacco Growers\\' Association says that could threaten the makers of burley tobacco, an air-cured leaf that has long been sweetened with additives, costing millions of farmers their jobs and devastating economies worldwide. \"We all know the real objective here is to eliminate tobacco consumption,\" says Roger Quarles, a Kentucky grower and president of the association.', 'abstract': 'Tobacco companies are stepping up efforts around the world to fight tough restrictions on the marketing of cigarettes.', 'article_id': '897228e5-bca5-5dc9-8c6a-969f43fd1449', 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/11/14/business/14smoke-span/14smoke-span-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=387&w=600&s=5ddfe4018bd7d7002f1b29a14e72fde12ae6bb142a6711ea9c27a2c5d3033b63&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1', 'caption': 'Workers making cigarettes in East Java in Indonesia.

Its resulting legacy has been mixed -- from slickly produced multiday affairs to unmitigated disasters, like the Fyre Festival -- but the wildfire-spread of festivals since has led to an increasing number of exciting, smaller-scale events organized each year. These eight U.S.-based music festivals are notable for their stunning settings, extracurricular programming and highly curated, alternative lineups. Marfa Myths is a collaboration between Ballroom Marfa, a nonprofit cultural arts space, and the Brooklyn-based record label Mexican Summer. Since it began four years ago, in a West Texas town internationally recognized for its art and culture, Marfa Myths has showcased a diverse roster of under-the-radar talent. Expect the same this year, with acts like Khruangbin and Cass McCombs. And don\\'t miss the art exhibitions around town. PRO TIP \"Bring boots, and hydrate!\" advises Sarah Melendez, the Ballroom Marfa program director. Booking accommodations and meal reservations in advance is a must, too. April 25-28 in Marfa, Tex. $220 for an all-access pass; tickets available for individual shows $15-$55\\n\\n\"Everyone is a creative,\" is the philosophy of FORM, to be held for its sixth year in Arcosanti, in Arizona, an \"urban laboratory\" established in the 1970s. FORM utilizes the striking desert landscape in programming its weekend full of music, poetry, wellness and advocacy. Musical acts including Anderson .Paak and Florence and the Machine play in Arcosanti\\'s intimate outdoor amphitheater. Enjoy the workshops and the music; relaxing by the pool is an option too. EQUAL ACCESS This festival offers different levels of camping, from D.I.Y. tent sites to all-inclusive glamping. But those differences stop at accommodations; No V.I.P. sections or access are available otherwise. May 10-12 in Arcosanti, Az. $379 for a weekend pass, basic camping included; glamping add-ons start at $349\\n\\nIt\\'s the 10th anniversary of this scrappy festival organized by Gundlach Bundschu winery, Eric D. Johnson of the Fruit Bats and FolkYeah!, a Northern California music promoter. Held on the winery grounds, Huichica keeps attendance tight -- just 600-800 people are there at any given time. (No worries: Additional festivals are planned later this year for the Hudson Valley and Washington state). Musical highlights this year include Love, Kelly Stoltz, and Lee Fields and the Expressions. It\\'s an intimate environment: Expect to see musicians watching the show, not hiding out backstage. KIDS WELCOMED While Huichica is not a children\\'s festival, it\\'s decidedly family-friendly, with a dedicated kid zone that makes it easy for parents to start them young. June 7-8 in Sonoma, Calif. From $155 for a weekend pass; children under 12 attend free\\n\\nWilco lovers unite at this festival highlighting Jeff Tweedy and company\\'s current musical favorites. This year, Courtney Barnett, The Feelies and Tortoise will join Wilco, plus band members\\' solo work. The musical performances are integrated within Mass MoCA\\'s expansive grounds and contemporary art collection. Not into art? Festival goers can attend an axe-throwing workshop, or for a more sedate activity, attend a panel featuring Jon Hamm and John Hodgman. EARLY BIRD GETS THE ART Attendees are advised to arrive before the shows to best explore the museum; you\\'ll be better equipped to seek out last-minute musician pop-ups, which are often announced on Twitter. June 28-30 in North Adams, Mass. From $189 for a weekend pass; day passes from $74-$129\\n\\nWith a zero-waste ethos, the Pickathon festival combines art, architecture, food and music. Its Treeline Stage is designed annually by architecture students using sustainable materials (last year\\'s stage was later used to build homeless shelters). This year, the lineup includes Nathaniel Rateliff and the Night Sweats, Phil Lesh, and The Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and will be bracketed by morning yoga, late-night dance parties and a street art showcase. EAT UP Join a Curation Series dinner, a communal, sit-down dinner party for 100 that pairs cuisine from top Pacific Northwest chefs and live music (tickets on sale in April). Aug. 2-4 in Happy Valley, Ore. From $325 for an adult weekend pass; early entry add-on for $90 The interactive artists\\' collective Meow Wolf organized Taos Vortex last year to bring mind-bending art installations and musical performances to Kit Carson Park, walking distance from downtown Taos. Year two boasts more acts reflecting New Mexico\\'s diverse population (the full lineup will be announced April 2) and no shortage of art you can touch. Camping is available for 1,000 (out of 6,000 expected attendees) and Max Beck-Keller of Meow Wolf encourages all to \"inhabit the space, make it your home.\" ADVENTURE TIME To highlight the beauty of Taos, the festival organizes outdoor adventures including balloon rides and paddle boarding on the Rio Grande. Aug. 16-18 in Taos, N.M. From $199 for a three-day pass with camping, $179 without; day passes from $79\\n\\nAfropunk Brooklyn is entering its 20th year celebrating black culture. With a musical lineup ranging from jazz to hard-core hip-hop, the two-day festival also boasts the Spinthrift Market, a destination for art, fashion and hair products, plus the live Solutions Sessions talks featuring likes of Ava Duvernay and Terence Nance. Despite having grown in scope and size -- the weekend sees 60,000 attendees -- the co-founder Matthew Morgan notes that positive vibes have persisted. STRAIGHT FROM THE LOWER LATITUDES Expect to hear acts from Johannesburg and other areas of South Africa thanks to an Afropunk expansion into that country. Aug. 24-25 in Brooklyn.

            "Article 2: {'section': 'Style', 'headline': 'The Repurposing of a Vogue Editor', 'article_url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/style/tonne-goodman-vogue-memoir.html', 'article': 'Tonne Goodman has a mantra for when things start to get a little messy: \"This is happening for a reason.\" She is known for saying it on fashion sets when a model calls in sick or a runway look is stuck in customs. And also when far more serious situations arise, like when she was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 44 . She finds it reassuring because, as she explained, whatever then happens is some kind of fate, and in that lies mystery and curiosity. Often, it leads you on a better path. Certainly, Ms. Goodman whispered the mantra aloud last summer when it was decided, by the powers that be, that she would surrender her role as fashion director of Vogue, where she had worked for nearly 20 years, and become a contributing editor -- a growing trend, these days, in the struggling magazine industry. Without a doubt, she has found herself on a curious new path. \"My overriding feeling is this is exciting,\" she said, seated on a white slipcovered couch in her Greenwich Village apartment , where she has lived for two decades. But her \"inner feeling,\" she said, is something like fear.\\n\\nDressed in her crisp, unwavering wardrobe of white Levi\\'s, Italian driving loafers and a silk Charvet scarf wrapped precisely around her neck, Ms. Goodman cuts a rather cool figure. From afar, she is the reserved, aloof foil to the colorful Grace Coddington, another Vogue editor. In practice, though, she is \"the nicest\" of the magazine\\'s editors, as many of those who have worked with her attest . While at Vogue she is known for styling her subjects in a classic, clean-cut manner -- \"the practical woman,\" as she put it -- Ms. Goodman said that she loves \"to do crazy things.\" Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, who assisted Ms. Goodman for four years at Vogue before becoming the style director of Garage magazine, said: \"She\\'s quiet and not bombastic and wears a uniform every day, but Tonne changed this industry and the way Americans look at fashion. Tonne is rad. She is the definition of radical.\" And in this new phase of her life, Ms. Goodman, 66, seems eager to reveal as much. Cue her forthcoming book, \"Point of View,\" which features, on an opening page, a full-frontal of Ms. Goodman, from her modeling days.\\n\\nSam Shahid, the book\\'s art director and a longtime friend, sneaked the nude in, and for a while tried to hide it from her, but Ms. Goodman loved the idea. \"One assumes this is just another fashion editor\\'s book, and it\\'s not,\" she said. Granted, it is filled with one gorgeous and iconic image after another, stretching from her early days as a fashion reporter for The New York Times through her seminal stints as vice president for advertising at Calvin Klein and fashion director of Harper\\'s Bazaar, to her tenure at Vogue, during which she styled more than 150 covers. It is also quite personal, revealing pictures and anecdotes from her days growing up on the Upper East Side, the daughter of an artist and a surgeon, both of whom -- not surprisingly -- were attractive and stylish. Her mother wore a floor-length circle skirt for dinner every night, paired with cashmere and pearls. Her father would change into a green velvet smoking jacket. According to family lore, the photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt proclaimed them the handsomest couple in New York.\\n\\nThere are also striking photos of Maarten, a Dutch sailor with whom Ms. Goodman ran off to sea for four months at the age of 17; and Rob, a troubled waiter she fell madly for and followed to the desert. She does not include images of Bailey Gimbel, the man she married and with whom she had two children, though she does mention their split. In fact, she touches, sparingly, on several searing aspects of her life, among them her bout with cancer, which coincided with the end of her marriage; and the time she feared she was having a miscarriage while in Paris for the collections.\\n\\nThe photographer Mario Testino, whom she didn\\'t know well at the time, drove her in his Fiat Cinquecento to the hospital, where they learned that her son, Cole, now 25, was alive and well. Mr. Testino became his godfather. \"It\\'s all part of my fabric,\" she said of including such intimate details. \"The reason any photo shows up is because of what I experienced.\" She recalled one particularly emotional picture, shot by Peter Lindbergh during her Harper\\'s Bazaar days. It features Amber Valletta running through the city wearing a set of wings. \"I was pregnant with Cole at the time,\" said Ms. Goodman, who also has a daughter named Evie. \"This was my angel.\"\\n\\nWhen it came to the book\\'s cover, Evie, an artist, balked at the idea of using the very classic and minimalist David Sims image of Daria Werbowy in a Calvin Klein gown. \"She thought it was too obvious,\" Ms. Goodman said. \"That it didn\\'t reflect all of me.\" Alas, Evie\\'s racier pick, a Steven Klein photo of Ms. Valletta looking like a 1960s housewife who is up to no good, was nixed . \"It\\'s actually one of my favorite pictures ,\" Ms Goodman said. \"But it didn\\'t look like me.\" If Ms. Goodman\\'s creative output is, in part, a reflection of her life, it appears that she is having a ball these days. With Ms. Karefa-Johnson, she styled a rollicking evening wear story called \"Black Cotillion\" for Garage magazine.', 'abstract': 'After almost 20 years at the magazine, Tonne Goodman is cutting loose.

His approach -- emphasizing lower tariffs, accurate economic data, trade pacts and the freer flow of capital -- was largely aimed at coaxing foreign investment back to Argentina and ending the economic exile that followed the country\\'s default in 2001. But over the last week, Argentina has been reminded that when capital is free to flow in, it can also flow out, creating profound economic implications. With foreign investors pulling their money en masse, Argentina\\'s central bank was forced to take drastic action to stabilize the country\\'s currency. On Friday, policymakers lifted the benchmark interest rate to 40 percent after days of intervening heavily in financial markets.\\n\\nWhile it helped settle the markets, the move will weigh on the prospects for the president\\'s ambitious economic overhaul. It also has the potential to crimp growth, adding to political discontent. The rate increase, a day after the Argentine peso fell 8.5 percent against the dollar, was the third in a week. The central bank said it would use \"all the tools at its disposal\" to slow inflation, which in March was up 25 percent from a year earlier, to 15 percent this year, a goal most analysts now see as unrealistic. In parallel, officials announced that they would cut government spending, and reduce the primary budget deficit to 2.7 percent, from the earlier goal of 3.2 percent. Their decision was seen as a response to criticism from investors that Mr. Macri\\'s government had not been cutting spending quickly enough. Mr. Macri was sworn into office in December 2015. Argentina had been closed to international markets for more than a decade amid a long-running legal fight with bondholders that followed a default on its debt. Early on, Mr. Macri\\'s policies were greeted with widespread optimism by financial markets, which gobbled up the country\\'s newly issued bonds.\\n\\nIn a show of market confidence, prices for the country\\'s government bonds rose, pushing interest rates lower. Those lower rates helped to stimulate economic growth. \"There was overconfidence on the part of policymakers about how much could be done given the constraints they had,\" said Alvaro Vivanco, a strategist covering Latin American bond and currency markets for the Spanish bank BBVA. But doubts about the government\\'s ability to quickly push through the changes have emerged in recent months. In January, Argentina\\'s central bank cut interest rates and increased its inflation target, a decision interpreted by some as weakening the government\\'s commitment to getting consumer prices under control. \"The central bank was cutting, with inflation expectations deteriorating,\" said Gabriel Gersztein, head of Latin American strategy at BNP Paribas. \"And this was a wake-up call for international investors.\" The global economic backdrop has also been changing. With the United States economy on solid footing, its short-term interest rates have been rising. That has put upward pressure on the United States dollar, and has resulted in a slide for the peso. That decline in the peso has accelerated in recent days, as foreign investors began to see their returns vaporized by the falling currency.\\n* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.\\n* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.\\n* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. People moved to the exits, in part because of a new income tax on foreign investors. As more and more investors pulled out, Argentina was suddenly facing a currency run. Argentine officials have struggled to shore up the currency. Since March, Argentina has spent more than $7.7 billion of its international reserves, with the pace speeding up late last week.\\n\\nGovernments have a few tools they can use to stem the outflow of capital. One of them is to sharply raise interest rates. Those higher rates translate into potentially stronger returns for investors. As such, they can attract money into an economy, which helps prop up a currency. But it\\'s a tricky play to pull off. Brazil raised interest rates sharply to stop an outflow of capital in the late 1990s, ultimately pushing benchmark interest rates to roughly 40 percent. More recently, in 2014, Turkey suddenly ratcheted up a key central bank rate to 10 percent from 4.5 percent in order to stop a sell-off in the lira. That same year, the central bank of Russia pushed interest rates sharply higher -- to 17 percent from 10.5 percent -- to keep the ruble from collapsing in response to sanctions over the annexation of Crimea and a sharp drop in oil prices. Russia also has one of the biggest interest-rate jumps on record, when in 1998 its rates reached 150 percent in an effort to stem another impending collapse of the ruble. But high interest rates have economic costs. They make it particularly difficult for businesses and consumer to borrow money. The lack of spending, in turn, can slow growth and ultimately spark a recession. The key for Argentina will be to keep rates high just long enough to inspire confidence that policymakers have halted the currency run, but not so long that the increase drains the economy. \"This was done in order to stop the bleeding,\" Mr. Gersztein of BNP Paribas said. \"It\\'s like you have someone in the E.R. You need to take very short-term, bold decisions. \"Then once you stabilize the patient,\" he added, \"you need to take different decisions in order to make the patient get better and recover.\"\\n\\nPolitically, it all puts Mr. Macri in a more precarious position. In recent months, his popularity has declined. In an April poll of Argentines by Synopsis, a local consultancy, 43 percent said they had a negative view of the government, compared with 34 percent with a positive view. That was a sharp shift from November, when nearly 52 percent said they had a positive image of the government and Mr. Macri\\'s allies did better than expected in midterm elections. The president is now balancing the concerns of a restive population and the needs of international investors -- and they don\\'t necessarily want the same thing. International investors want assurance that Mr. Macri will continue to cut spending and stick with other parts of his plan. But those same efforts are frustrating certain constituencies at home. Unions are worried that workers are losing purchasing power amid high inflation and a broad increase in public utility rates, part of the government\\'s efforts to decrease spending by slashing subsidies. Hundreds gathered on Friday in downtown Buenos Aires outside the National Electricity Regulator for a union protest against recent increases in utility prices. Last month, thousands took to the streets to protest the hikes. The higher utility costs are hitting the manufacturing sector hard, particularly companies that compete against imported goods. Ancers, a tableware manufacturer in Buenos Aires, has seen its gas bill soar by 48 percent while electricity costs have doubled since the beginning of last year. During that time, the number of employees has declined by 25 percent, said Angel Vazquez, the company\\'s founder and president. \"We may very well have to close soon,\" Mr. Vazquez said. \"I don\\'t know if we can hold out for another year.\"\\n\\nWhat happens next with the economy may translate into whether Mr. Macri\\'s coalition will win the presidential election next year or whether discontent will give rise to an interventionist government that will undo many of his changes. Although the economy as a whole is growing -- expanding 5.1 percent in February, on the year -- the latest measures are prompting some analysts to revise their forecasts downward. \"The government so far has not been able to show big victories, and it\\'s obvious that if it is going to take unpopular measures, its popularity will suffer,\" said Fausto Spotorno, the chief economist at Orlando Ferreres & Asociados, a local consultancy. \"But it has rushed many of the measures so that it can avoid bad news next year.\"', 'abstract': \"The move seeks to stabilize the country's currency, the peso, after a strong depreciation in recent days raised questions about the prospects for President Mauricio Macri's ambitious agenda.\", 'article_id': 'ee111efe-5583-5d14-bff8-6527244f3867', 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/05/business/05argentinaecon-1/05argentinaecon-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=316d8446bf2b579dd114da13713fca766ad5d0a43a270fbc1c01bed5f2f01953&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN', 'caption': 'The central bank of Argentina said it would use \"all the tools at its disposal\" to slow inflation to 15 percent this year, a goal analysts see as unrealistic.', 'image_id': 'ee111efe-5583-5d14-bff8-6527244f3867'}\n"
